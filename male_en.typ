This Panikzettel is about the new lecture "Elements of Machine Learning and Data Science", a compulsory subject of the new Bachelor of Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University.

This Panikzettel is open source at #link("https://git.rwth-aachen.de/jonas.max.schneider/panikzettel", `https://git.rwth-aachen.de/jonas.max.schneider/panikzettel`). We welcome comments and suggestions for improvement (also from official sources).

It is often difficult to determine the exact focus of the lecture and the exams, but with this new subject especially since no exams or the like are known yet

The Panikzettel in #link("https://htwr-aachen.de/panikzettel/male.pdf")[german] is largely finished, it will be translated in some time... by someone...
